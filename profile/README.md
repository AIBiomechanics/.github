# University of Florida AI Biomechanics Laboratory (AIBL)

Welcome to the GitHub organization for the **AI Biomechanics Lab (AIBL)** at the University of Florida.

We use data science, machine learning, and biomechanics to study the relationships between human movement and musculoskeletal health, with a particular focus on osteoarthritis. Our work encompasses data collection in real-world settings, traditional-lab based data collection, development of new analysis pipelines, and translation of biomechanical insights to improve health outcomes.

## ðŸ”¬ Current Research Themes
- **Real-world human movement analysis** using wearable and markerless motion capture  
- **Machine learning for biomechanics**: clustering, classification, and prediction  
- **Biomechanical phenotyping and loading signatures**  
- **Open-source tools** for movement analysis and visualization  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repositories
This organization includes both public and private repositories. A few highlights:
- `most-ml`: Machine learning analyses on the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) dataset  
- `most-ax3-processing`: Python tools to process raw Axivity AX3 and AX6 accelerometry data  
- `participant-reports`: Templates for automated participant motion capture feedback reports  
- `g-comp-most`: Tools for causal modeling in osteoarthritis research  

We are working on releasing **synthetic test datasets** and generalized versions of our tools to support open science and reproducibility.

## ðŸ“¬ Get Involved
We welcome:
- Collaborators interested in biomechanics, data science, and musculoskeletal health  
- Students and trainees eager to contribute to open, interdisciplinary research  
- Researchers looking to adapt our tools for their own datasets
